[AWS Solutions Constructs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/constructs/welcome.html)


AWS Solutions Constructs (Constructs) is an open-source extension of the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) that provides multi-service, well-architected patterns for quickly defining solutions in code to create predictable and repeatable infrastructure. The goal is to accelerate the experience for developers to build solutions of any size using pattern-based definitions for their architecture.

Use the AWS Solutions Constructs to define your solutions in a familiar programming language. The AWS Solutions Constructs supports TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, and Java at this time.
